## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-27

- `SezzleWidgetConfig` — configurable widget with PI4/PI5/long-term support matching sezzle-js source of truth
- PI4: "or 4 payments of $X" (default, under $50)
- PI5: "or 5 payments of $X" (enabled, $50+)
- Long-term: "or monthly payments as low as $X" (configurable threshold, APR amortization)
- Removed "interest-free" from all messaging (matches sezzle-js)
- `SezzleInfoModal` now shows PI4, PI5, or long-term modal based on price
- `SezzleCheckoutMode` — choose between `.systemBrowser` (default) or `.webView`
- WebView mode: loading spinner, white header with "sezzle.com", `isWebView=true` query param
- Example app shows all 4 widget variants: hidden, PI4, PI5, and long-term

### Fixed
- Guard against double delegate callbacks — delivers results exactly once per checkout
